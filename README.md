# congenial-asteroid-queryer
A simple interface to query NASA's Near Earth Object Database and see what's floating around our space.


AS AN interested member of this solar system
I WANT an easy interface to query Earth's closest neighbors
SO THAT I can schedule opportunities to see them, be aware of the largest and nearest of them, and chart relationships between NEOs and Earth.
